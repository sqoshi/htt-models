## About The Project

The htt-models package facilitates the training, processing, and versioning of machine learning models required for the Hands-to-Text application, which interprets hand gestures in real-time.

This package enables training models on hand gesture datasets such as MNIST and ASL Hands, providing state-of-the-art recognition of American Sign Language (ASL) letters. It includes multiple model implementations to ensure flexibility and robustness in recognition accuracy.

Additionally, trained models are packaged as pre-built Docker images, allowing seamless deployment across different environments, ensuring portability and ease of use.
